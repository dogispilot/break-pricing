Chicago fans will be happy that this release does have one Connor Bedard card but it is a Team Canada Redemption, see more the card on the Top Rookies Page. With the dual year it is also possible that a rookie have his Rookie cards and Second year cards in this product. Please note that Wayne Gretzky has cards for Edmonton and Los Angeles and John Leclair has them for Montreal and Philadelphia, oddly Henrik Sedin has a card but his brother does not which is also a first we believe. ALL redemption cards are accompanied by a Bonus Canvas Rookie Debuts card, also sealed in a one-touch. Both years have The 200-Card Base Set consists of rookie, veteran and legend autograph cards. There are three low numbered parallels of complete base set: Exclusives (/65, /35 or /15), High Gloss (/10) and One-of-One (/1). This Checklist From Upper Deck Was Made Available to the Public 13 Days Before the Product was Released, excellent job.",

With the dual year it is also possible that a rookie have his Rookie cards and Second year cards in this product. Please note that Wayne Gretzky has cards for Edmonton and Los Angeles and John Leclair has them for Montreal and Philadelphia, oddly Henrik Sedin has a card but his brother does not which is also a first we believe. ALL redemption cards are accompanied by a Bonus Canvas Rookie Debuts card, also sealed in a one-touch. Both years have The 200-Card Base Set consists of rookie, veteran and legend autograph cards.

It featured a glossy green background base card and you could tell if there was an autograph because those cards had a matt finish, and all packs had a mini card. Glancing at this product we really think it will be popular with the large base set of 350, a good rookie class and tons of current and past super stars. Unlike the older version of Parkie this one has memorabilia cards as well, the Mini Cards are long gone but they did retain the Wire Photo set.",

Sure I basically killed the good value but I still own that card, now its safely in a toploader and team bag and sitting in my display case of goodies. This years hobby boxes have a new parallel, the purple borders /49 and the popular playing card inserts are back and also watch for the manufactured patches which drop about 4 per case.

All new this year is a Team Twigs card which features 3 pieces of stick memorabilia and usually a mix of current stars and legends on the same card, sadly they are all 10 copies each so it will be expensive and difficult to get the entire set. Trilogy has a large amount of rookie cards with the percentage almost at 50 and also a fair amount of retired stars, it was nice to see the inclusion of Jason Arnott and Pete Stemkowski who are rarely seen in newer Hockey products. The Generations cards are also nice as there is 3 cards when put side by side will spell out the word generations and it will have a past, present and future star and would make a nice display. Trilogy will be even more expensive because of the inclusion of Connor Bedard , check out his full master checklist here .

It is really nice to see a product where all cards are signed in person and not on a sticker and later attached to the card and it means your favorite player held the card. A quick look at the sell sheet for Ultimate and it's plain to see the quality patches and card designs but that comes at a harder hit to the wallet, Ultimate will be pricey.
